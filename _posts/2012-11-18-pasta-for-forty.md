About four years ago my friend Tom served me his bolgonese at a dinner party, and I&#8217;d never tasted something so good. Since he&#8217;s a Manhattanite, and I live on the other side of the country in San Francisco, I set out to learn to make it myself, starting with roughly his original recipe.

My first few tries were okay. Good enough to the point where I thought I could test it on my friends and they&#8217;d be happy with it. Nothing unites people quite like food and drink, especially when it&#8217;s all free, and soon I found myself running out of food, as my weekly &#8220;Pasta Night&#8221; expanded from my roommates to a good slice of everyone I knew in the city.

Being forced to scale the recipe, crowd-sourcing reviews and advice, and iteration wrought a positive evolution of the results. I have vegetarian friends, so eventually my bolognese became a tomato sauce, then I added optional meatballs, and then finally the choice of spaghetti and meatballs for the omnivores and penne with vodka sauce for everyone.

It takes time to make a good sauce. Members of my international warehouse told me their Italian grandmothers start on their sauce at 5am stewing their sauce with a whole pork shoulder, bone and all. Cooking is chemistry, and the longer you cook a sauce the better it is. But my work is demanding, so I&#8217;ve never spent more than 5 hours total prep time.

Next, I&#8217;ll post my much requested [recipe][1].
