In San Francisco, I'm continuously surrounded by people with good follow-through. When the majority of people around you are industrious, it's infectious. It fosters an environment with a lot of forward momentum. 

Follow through is important because people learn most effectively by [doing][1]. You can understand something is right conceptually without knowing it in your gut, but guts are what count, and they're developed as a result of practically applying your knowledge. This is one of the reasons why the [Thiel Fellowship][2] makes sense - in the real world "book smarts" don't beat practical experience.

Productivity is important and it's tempting for us to equate [getting things done][3] with the fecundity of our output. Taking time to think can often feel like we're just dragging our feet, or lacking focus. 

But mental consideration should not be relegated to brainstorming goals and setting them, with the premise being that once those decisions are made, follow-through is all that's required. Rather, it's good to stop and reflect on your progress from time to time to make sure that your beginning assumptions haven't been invalidated and that the tactics you're using to accomplish your goals are adequate.

This additional step is what I call *using your periscope* (i.e. look up and see where you're heading once in awhile) and it can be especially frustrating for those who are impatient to see their vision brought into reality. That is because, in addition to making us feel like we're slowing down, reflection calls our current progress into question. 

You may be forced to ask yourself, "Did I just spend all this time building something useless?", and you might have. To make matters worse, you may not have learned anything useful from the experience either, but the time to recognize that is now, before more time and resources are wasted.

Everything planned is based on a hypothesis, everything carried out is an experiment. Periodically evaluate your progress in each part of your life, adjust your plans as necessary and don't be afraid to move on to the next trial when you've identified that the current one has run it's course.
