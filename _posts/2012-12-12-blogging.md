Blogging is telling all those stories you've been telling your friends and family.  But, in a forum that is public and scalable.  Everyone has stories that define them, indeed, storytelling is the most effective mode of communication humans have practiced since pre-history. 

The problem is that the most interesting people tend to devalue the stories they have to tell.  Their stories are interesting because they seek interest, and don't find that quality in their accomplishments to date.  

That isn't to say that people should simply value what they've done and cease to move forward.  Rather, they should practice gratitude, relish in their past success, move forward to new challenges and tell their story for whatever it's worth.

If Forrest Gump taught us anything, the true worth of a life is in the courage practiced.  Courage breeds persistence.  Courage welcomes challenge.  A persistent focus on a challenge creates solutions and greater challenges.  The greatest solution is predicated on the greatest challenge.

If nothing else, I aim to have the courage to tell my story.
