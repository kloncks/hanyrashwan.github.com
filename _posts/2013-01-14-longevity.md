It's cliche to say that *money doesn't buy happiness*. And while  there are elements of truth in that statement, cliches have a knack for painting concepts in black and white. The truth is, having [some money does buy happiness][3], as it reduces the stress of providing basic needs for you and your family. 

But, there's a point whereby acquiring a higher standard of living reaches diminishing returns. At this threshold, wherever it may be for you ($75k USD per year is typical), you would only be marginally more happy with an increase in salary. You don't need steak every night, and as someone who was fortunate enough to experience this personally, after a few months you probably will get sick of living on a beach.

The other night I watched a couple related documentaries, [How To Live Forever][1] and [Transcendent Man][2]. Both were fantastic at reviewing man's recent efforts to attain improved longevity, the second detailing Ray Kurzweil's quest for immortality. 

In the end, these documentaries rekindled in me a thought I got pretty hung up with during my first year of university.

Longevity is different than long life in that it's a long life lived happily and with your health. All the metrics on money and happiness rely on life being finite. But eventually, it may be extendible thorough medical treatments. 

Even if you want to suggest that these will come down in price, there will invariably be a transition period where a longer, better life would prohibitively expensive for all but the most wealthy of individuals. It's looking more likely that this could happen within our lifetimes, or at least our children's.

There's always been ethical debate on whether or not everlasting life would be a [good][4] [thing][5]. My guess is most of this is mostly academic - things you might say when something isn't possible. I'd estimate that when it actually became available, much of the debate would end and people would look to acquire immortality just as they accept more money.

My judgement on wealth has always centered around freedoms: freedom from need, and freedom from want. I don't need or want much more than I already have, and on my death bed, I wouldn't regret not ever owning a designer car or living in a mansion. However, I fear that I might regret the fact that I am about to die.
