Humans seek equilibrium in every facet of their lives. And while people talk about change being challenging, I don't often hear them talk about how deeply ingrained it is in each of us. 

Our bodies, after they get over the initial hump, can get used to anything, from carbohydrates, to alcohol, to caffeine.  Take one of those away for long enough and you'll have headaches, sickness, etc.  But after you get past the initial pain, your body gets used to it's new state.
